AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'localhost
(127.0.0.1) (1476)' for channel ISO.CMS was not successful. However the error
may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
111 (X'6F'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'localhost (127.0.0.1) (1476)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9999E: Channel 'ISO.BIF' to host 'localhost(1544)' ended abnormally.

EXPLANATION:
The channel program running under process ID 1049 for channel 'ISO.BIF' ended
abnormally. The host name is 'localhost(1544)'; in some cases the host name
cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Look at previous error messages for the channel program in the error logs to
determine the cause of the failure. Note that this message can be excluded
completely or suppressed by tuning the "ExcludeMessage" or "SuppressMessage"
attributes under the "QMErrorLog" stanza in qm.ini. Further information can be

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'localhost
(127.0.0.1) (1474)' for channel ISO.PAY was not successful. However the error
may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
111 (X'6F'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'localhost (127.0.0.1) (1474)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

abnormally. The host name is 'localhost(1434)'; in some cases the host name
cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Look at previous error messages for the channel program in the error logs to
determine the cause of the failure. Note that this message can be excluded
completely or suppressed by tuning the "ExcludeMessage" or "SuppressMessage"
attributes under the "QMErrorLog" stanza in qm.ini. Further information can be

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'localhost
(127.0.0.1) (1524)' for channel ISO.FNT was not successful. However the error
may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
111 (X'6F'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'localhost (127.0.0.1) (1524)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'localhost
(127.0.0.1) (1544)' for channel ISO.BIF was not successful. However the error
may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
111 (X'6F'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'localhost (127.0.0.1) (1544)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'localhost
(127.0.0.1) (1544)' for channel ISO.BIF was not successful. However the error
may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
111 (X'6F'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'localhost (127.0.0.1) (1544)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

abnormally. The host name is 'localhost(1524)'; in some cases the host name
cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Look at previous error messages for the channel program in the error logs to
determine the cause of the failure. Note that this message can be excluded
completely or suppressed by tuning the "ExcludeMessage" or "SuppressMessage"
attributes under the "QMErrorLog" stanza in qm.ini. Further information can be

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'localhost
(127.0.0.1) (1454)' for channel ISO.BDS was not successful. However the error
may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
111 (X'6F'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'localhost (127.0.0.1) (1454)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'localhost
(127.0.0.1) (1544)' for channel ISO.BIF was not successful. However the error
may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
111 (X'6F'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'localhost (127.0.0.1) (1544)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'localhost

may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
111 (X'6F'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'localhost (127.0.0.1) (1476)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.

AMQ9202E: Remote host not available, retry later.

EXPLANATION:
The attempt to allocate a conversation using TCP/IP to host 'localhost
(127.0.0.1) (1514)' for channel ISO.IVR was not successful. However the error
may be a transitory one and it may be possible to successfully allocate a
TCP/IP conversation later. 

In some cases the remote host cannot be determined and so is shown as '????'.
ACTION:
Try the connection again later. If the failure persists, record the error
values and contact your systems administrator. The return code from TCP/IP is
111 (X'6F'). The reason for the failure may be that this host cannot reach the
destination host. It may also be possible that the listening program at host
'localhost (127.0.0.1) (1514)' was not running.  If this is the case, perform
the relevant operations to start the TCP/IP listening program, and try again.
