# This file allows client wide configuration properties to be specified
# The properties below include properties for the Java SE environment
# and for use with WMQ 
#
# To use this file invoke the JVM as follows
# 
#  java -Dcom.ibm.msg.client.config.location=file:///f:/amqp_trace.config  my.java.applicationClass
#
#  Supported URL types are file:// http:// ftp://  jar://
#
# Note: that 'Start-Up Trace' can not be specified via this file and must be specified on 
# JVM system property as follows
#
#  java -Dcom.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.trace.startup=true  my.java.applicationClass

# Java 2 SE Enviroment Trace Settings

# Is trace initially started or stoped? Set to ON to gather early trace.
# 
# Valid values
#           ON   - Trace is on
#           OFF  - Trace is off (Default)
com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.trace.status=OFF

# Level of trace.  A value of 4 will produce trace for level 4 and all levels
# numerically lower than 4  (i.e. levels 1,2,3)
#
# Valid values
#                  1 - Exceptions 
#                  3 - Warnings
#                  6 - Info
#                  8 - Entry Exit
#                  9 - Data
#  Integer.MAX_VALUE - Everything (Default)  
#com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.trace.level=99

# The output name of the trace file. Can be either absolute or relative
# %PID% will be replaced with the Process ID of the running process
# If running on Java 1.4.2 this will be a fake process if  - prefixed with 'f'
#com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.trace.outputName=amqp_%PID%.trc

# Trace exclusion and inclusion
#
# Note that the package inclusion and exclusion lists work in concert with
# each other.  When determining the packages the exclusion list is processed
# first, and then the inclusion list is superimposed. So if a package
# is in both lists then it will be included

# Subpackages.  For example,  if package "a.b" was excluded and package "a.b.x" was 
# included then the trace would include everything in "a.b.x" and "a.b.x.1" etc, 
# but not "a.b.y", "a.b.z" etc.

# include a ; separated list of the packages or fully qualified class names that will be traced
# ALL indicates ALL packages to be traced and is the default.
#com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.trace.include=ALL

# exclude a ; separated list of the packages or fully qualified class names that will NOT
# be traced
# NONE indicates NO packages to be excluded and is the default
#com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.trace.exclude=NONE

# For example to just trace the package com.ibm.mq.jms and com.ibm.msg.client.wmq
# use these settings - note the exclude=ALL is important otherwise everything is traced
#com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.trace.include=com.ibm.mq.jms;com.ibm.msg.client.wmq
#com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.trace.include=com.ibm.mq.communications;com.ibm.mq.MQXRService
#com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.trace.exclude=ALL

# Specifies the maximum number of bytes that will be trace from any call
# to trace message data
#
# Valid values
#   Positive integer - data will be written up to that value of bytes per trace call
#                0   - means no data will be written
#               -1   - means unlimited  (default)
com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.trace.maxBytes=1024

# This specifies the maximum number of bytes that will be written to any one
# trace file
#   Positive integer - data will be written up to that value of bytes per trace file
#                0   - means no data will be written
#               -1   - means unlimited  (default)
#com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.trace.limit=-1

# The number of trace files to cycle through. As each file reaches
# com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.trace.limit trace will begin in the next file
# 
# Valid values
#   Positive integer - number of files to cycle through
#                0   - a single file (default)
# com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.trace.count=1

# Controls whether method parameters and return values should be traced
# 
# Valid values   
#              TRUE  -  values traced (Default) 
#             FALSE  -  values NOT traced
#com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.trace.parameter=true

# Controls whether trace is compressed
# SHOULD NOT BE USED IF JVM HAS BEEN SEEND TO CRASH IN SCENARIO TO BE TRACED
# AS COMPRESSED FILE MAY BE RENDERED UNREADABLE
# 
# Valid values   
#              TRUE  -  commpression on  
#             FALSE  -  compression off (Default)
#com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.trace.compress=false

# Regular expression filter that is applied to the trace
# If this matches, then the trace point is not traced.
#
# The string that is matched is formed from the classname followed by a . 
# and the method name.
#
# Note the classname is formed first with the fully qualified name of the class
# of the current object. If the class where the implementation of the current
# method in is different then this classname follows in brackets (with no packagename)
# This may occur if a method defined in a superclass is being used
#
# The current regular expresion is good a filtering out lesser used parts of trace

# Logging

# Name of the log file
# Can be absolute or relative to the queue manager errors directory.
com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.log.outputName=amqp_%g.log

# Specifies the maximum number of bytes that will be logged from any call
# to log message data
#
# Valid values
#   Positive integer - data will be written up to that value of bytes per log call
#                0   - means no data will be written
#               -1   - means unlimited  (default)
#com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.log.maxBytes=-1

# This specifies the maximum number of bytes that will be written to any one
# log file
#   Positive integer - data will be written up to that value of bytes per log file
#                0   - means no data will be written
#               -1   - means unlimited  (default)
#com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.log.limit=0

# The number of log files to cycle through. As each file reaches
# com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.trace.limit trace will begin in the next file
# 
# Valid values
#   Positive integer - number of files to cycle through
#                0   - a single file (default)
#com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.log.count=1

 
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Java SE Specifics

# Should a JavaCore file be written when immeditaly after an FDC file has been generated?
# If set to true a JavaCore file will be produced (subject to the JVM's ability to do so)
#
# Valid values   
#              TRUE  -  do generate JavaCore  
#             FALSE  -  do not generate JavaCore (Default)

# Client-mode Specifics

# Polling interval to check for broken connections when waiting for a server response
#
# Valid values
#   Positive integer - number of milliseconds to wait before checking
#                      default value is 10000 or 10 seconds
#                      minimum value is 3000, lower values will be treated as this
